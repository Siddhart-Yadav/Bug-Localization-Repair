## Repository Structure
This repository contains both the final project files and experimental work from the development process. The `project.zip` includes:
- Final implementation files
- Experimental code and iterations
- Development stage work

Some files in this repository represent experimental stages of development and may not be directly relevant to the final implementation. These were preserved to:
- Document the development journey
- Show different approaches that were tested
- Maintain a record of alternative solutions explored
