This  SoftEngProj ZIp file contains both the final project files and experimental work from the development process. The `SoftEngProj.zip` includes:
- Final implementation files
- Experimental code and iterations
- Development stage work
- Evaluation programs like test cases,comparison of different models, test cases from the quixbugs repository etc.

### Note on Experimental Files
Some files in this repository represent experimental stages of development and may not be directly relevant to the final implementation. These were preserved to:
- Document the development journey
- Show different approaches that were tested
- Maintain a record of alternative solutions explored
